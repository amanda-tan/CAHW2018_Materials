Rob To-Do list...
Create a World-Readable S3 bucket for data files 
Add the whale sounds files to this
Add the GLODAP files
Add other obvious files...
Modify the notebooks to read from S3... see for example Rob's notebooks in the ExternalResources Project
Create a binder link in the repo for demos
Just add 'Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally page/readme' cf geohackweek https://github.com/geohackweek/ghw2017/wiki/Running-Jupyter-Notebooks-Locally) and don’t worry about binder for the moment
