## Content
`netcdf_basic_example.ipynb` -  Programatically download and work with OOI NetCDF data without leaving the notebook.

`json_basic_example.ipynb` - Request OOI data as a synchronous (instantaneous) JSON data response. Data are decimated down to 20,000 data points. This data response type is useful for building real-time data display applications.


## Local Setup Instructions

During the workshop you will be provided with a JupyterHub workspace on the cloud and your environment will already be set up for you. If you would like to try out these notebooks on your local machine, you can proceed with the following instructions.

Download anaconda or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), then add the conda-forge channel.

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Create a virtual environment for this exercise called ooi2.

```
$ conda create -n ooi2 python=2 ipykernel requests thredds_crawler xarray netcdf4 pandas numpy matplotlib
```


Add the `ooi2` environment to jupyter as a selectable kernel for your user.

```
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name ooi2 --display-name "Python2 OOI"

```

Launch the local notebook server

```
$ jupyter notebook

```
