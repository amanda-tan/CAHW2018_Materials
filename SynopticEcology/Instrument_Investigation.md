## Data Investigation:  
Rob - Flourometer  
Katie - Oxygen, calibration  
Sasha - pH  
James - pressure versus time, velocity  
Wu-Jung and Robert - acoustics   
Allison - CTD   
Allison and Katie - Still camera   

Additional sensors to investigate:  
PAR, Spectrophotometer, Nitrate  

## Task 1: 
7:00 am August 21 to 7:00 am August 22 (UTC)  
Everyone has own notebook  
Read in data  
Make a plot (Depth versus Time or Concentration depth profiles)  

## Metadata:  
Rob and Eric - Sheet with important info on profiler movement, grid of instruments across locations.  

## Locations:  
offshore (Endurance), slope base (Cabled), axial base (Cabled)  

## Problem Sensors:    
pCO2 (known issue and known fix) 

## Drift problems:  
Profiler/Platform validation for sensors   
Note that the offset is 1 m between profiler and platform.  

## Profiler:   
average 5cm/s up and 10 cm/up  
9 times a day  
2 times a day step profile (solar noon and midnight)  
Turnaround point depends on waves.  
No waves - theoretically gets within 5 m of the surface (actual 7-10 m).  
Nitrate is only twice a day on step profiler.  
Optical attenuation sensor - only turned at beginning of step profiles - so only twice a day.   
Slope and axial have outward looking digital still cameras on the platform.
